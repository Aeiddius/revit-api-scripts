# Revit API Custom Scripts

The following is my scripts written in python which connects to the Revit API. They are made at my current as a BIM Modeller where I needed scripts to automate some tasks for the current high-rise building project which deals with a lot of typical units and redundant views.

Due to the nature of my work, I simply used a dynamo script to load my python scripts. The image below displays it where I used a script bundler custom node in order to reuse shared python codes across my different python scripts.
